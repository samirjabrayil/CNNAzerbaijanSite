            <h2>Elon Musk donated $1.9 billion of Tesla stock to undisclosed charity last year</h2>

            <b>New York CNN</b> — <em>Tesla CEO Elon Musk gave 11.5 million shares of his stake in the electric
                automaker to an undisclosed
                charity last year, shares worth about $1.9 billion at the time they were donated.</em>
            <br>

            The donation would make him the second largest charitable donor in 2022, according to a ranking of the
            Chronicle of Philanthropy, which was compiled before Musk’s filing. The Chronicle’s ranking lists Bill Gates
            as No. 1 with $5.1 billion in donations, followed by Michael Bloomberg at $1.7 billion.

            Musk’s net worth at the end of 2022 stood at $137 billion, according to Forbes’ real time billionaire
            tracker, so the $1.9 billion represented about 1.4% of his net worth at that time.

            Musk’s 2022 donations are down from the estimated value of his donations reported for 2021, when he reported
            that he had given 5 million Tesla (TSLA) shares, then worth an estimated $5.7 billion, at the end of that
            year. A three-for-one stock split in Tesla (TSLA) shares in August of last year means the number of shares
            he donated in 2021 was also 30% greater than his 2022 donations, on a split-adjusted basis.

            Musk’s donations in 2021 also were to an undisclosed charity. They came at a time that he had been
            challenged by David Beasley, the UN food program director, to donate $6 billion to battle global hunger.
            Beasley had said a donation of that size could feed more than 40 million people across 43 countries that are
            “on the brink of famine.” Musk responded on Twitter at that time if the World Food Program “can describe on
            this Twitter thread exactly how $6B will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it.”

            Musk’s 2021 donation of Tesla shares came soon after that exchange, but there was never any confirmation as
            to where the shares went to.

        <p><b>(CNN) —</b> <em>A confused woman asked her rescuers “What day is it?” when pulled alive from the rubble of
                last week’s
                earthquake after 228 hours, Turkey’s state-run news agency Anadolu reported Wednesday, as another woman
                aged
                77 was also rescued from the debris.
            </em>
            More than nine days after a powerful quake shook Turkey and Syria, rescuers were still pulling people from
            the rubble, defying predictions that the time for survival had passed. On Wednesday,
            Turkey’s Ministry of National Defense released video showing rescuers extricating the 77-year-old woman from
            debris in the city of Adiyaman on Tuesday,
            some 212 hours after the earthquake struck.

            Anadolu identified her as Fatma Gungor, and said her family hugged her after she was saved.

            The other woman questioned “What day is it?” after surviving under the rubble with her two children for 228
            hours, according to Turkey’s state-run news agency Anadolu. Rescue personnel Mehmet Eryilmaz talked about
            the moment they found the mother and said, “The mother was happy to see us. I held her hand at first. We
            talked, chatted, and calmed her down.”</p>
